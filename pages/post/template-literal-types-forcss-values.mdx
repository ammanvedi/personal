# Template Literal Types for CSS Values

I was enchanted at first when I saw the release of 
[template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html) in 
Typescript. I have seen people [do some really wild things](https://github.com/ghoullier/awesome-template-literal-types) with them.

But up until now I did not have a real use case for them in my day to day coding, the use case is 
related to when you need to store some sort of unit-ed css value. 

Some examples;

```ts
type PxValue = `${number}px`;
type HexValue = `#${string}`;
```

Commonly when you have a design system and you are using css in js you will store these
values in the source as constants somewhere. Now we can do it in a type safe way!

```ts
type Colors = Record<string, HexValue>

const c: Colors = {
    primary: '#212121',
    secondary: 'fff' // Error !
}
```

Another layer of protection for a mistake future-me will make, I guarantee it.
